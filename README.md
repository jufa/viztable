# viztable
Problem:
 - Visualize a variable length list of confidence intervals using the centroid of the interval as the sorting value. Allow resorting.

Solution:
 - D3 driven HTML table to allow for vairable lenth (100s of rows) 
 - last cell contains a horizontal box plot rendered as SVG
 - opacity of bar is related to confidence interval so that wider confindences look stretched and less significant
